# Si5351Linux
Linux interface to the Si5351Arduino Library

Altho this wrapper is somewhat functional, its intent is to explore
extending the NT7S Si5351 Arduino library to other platforms using git submodules
and brucemack's interface abstraction (https://github.com/brucemack/Si5351Arduino).

Some info on using submodules in projects here https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/
including info on first time clone to populate the submodules. And a good post 
https://stackoverflow.com/a/20797186 on detatched heads.
